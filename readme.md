Title: **Building RESTful Web APIs with Node.js and Express** <br>
Released: **27/10/2017**

> "Good news for JavaScript developers: Using Node.js and Express, you can build a web API to push and pull data from your applications via HTTP. You don't have to learn ASP.NET or Python. You don't even have to know that much about back-end programming. In this course, Emmanuel Henri shows how to create a simple, RESTful web API with these two popular JavaScript libraries. He shows how to set up the project, including the Express server and testing environment, and create the endpoints needed to add, update, and delete data from a MongoDB database. At the end of the course, he shows how to serve static files such as images with your new API, and explores additional libraries that can help streamline API development, such as Koa and LoopBack.

_Topics include:_
- Setting up a project and a server
- Setting up a database and schema
- Creating POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE endpoints
- Serving files"
